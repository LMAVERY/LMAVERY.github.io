# About me

## My Interests
I have an intense interest in learning how to make different projects and tend toÂ indoor plants. My mind is soothed when I'm working with my hands to create something lovely or take care of something lovely. I also enjoy taking pictures outside of nature and my children. If only I had enough hours in a day to complete everything.

## Websites I explore daily
- [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com) - I get a lot of inspiration from this website. It's where a lot of various things are posted and shared between millions of people.
- [Google](https://www.google.com) - I use Google to find many plant nurseries and look over their plant inventory. along with information about houseplants that I would need to review.
- [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com) - When it comes to crafting or just about anything in general, I can find about everything I need at a reasonable price. I adore the vast array of goods and merchandise they offer.
